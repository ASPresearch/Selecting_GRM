\section{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item Study how gene expression is regulated by methylation in a set of colon cancer cell lines.
\item Set up a method to detect the level of methylation at which a gene can be considered regulated by methylation (to be ``on").
\item Compare this method with other that have been developed to
  \begin{itemize}
  \item detect methylation thresholds and
  \item detect patterns in scatterplots.
  \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
