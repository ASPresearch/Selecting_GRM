\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Epigenetics and epigenomics}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Epigenetics, \emph{the study of environmental factors on gene
    expression in DNA}, shows a renewed impetus:
\begin{itemize}
\item NGS allows in-deep analysis of regulatory mechanisms such as
  \emph{methylation} or \emph{histone modifications}.
\item There is increasing evidence that many differentiation processes
  are triggered and maintained through epigenetic mechanisms.
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 
\end{column}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Methylation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of genes
  involved in the oncogenic process has been shown to be a key process
  contributing to tumor initiation and/or progression.
\item Essentially methylation acts by inhibiting gene expression that
  is, the more methylated is a gene the more repressed is its
  expression
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/methylationAction1.png}
\end{center}
%\item Methylation is seen however as a dual phenomenon\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A methylated gene is "off"\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3.1}
%\item An unmethlated gene is "on"\\
%\label{sec-1.8.3.2}
%\end{itemize} % ends low level
%\item So in practice an important practical problem is to determine at which methylation level a gene is seen as "methylated" (that is turned off).\\
%\label{sec-1.8.4}
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Methylation and gene expression}
\begin{itemize}
\item Although the relation between methylation and gene expression is probably continuous ("\emph{the more...the less...}"), 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/DNA-Methylation-and-Gene-Expression-Relationship.jpg}
\end{center}
\item methylation is, in practice, seen as a dual phenomenon
\begin{itemize}
\item A methylated gene is ``off''
\item An unmethylated gene is ``on''
\end{itemize} 
\item Practical problem: \textbf{\emph{at which methylation level a gene is seen as ``methylated'' (is it ``turned off'')?}}
\end{itemize} 

\end{frame}


\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}{Genome-wide analysis of colorectal cancer}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of genes
    involved in the oncogenic process has been shown to be a key
    process contributing to tumor initiation and/or progression.
  \item This study originates in a work \emph{aiming at the identification
    of genes regulated by methylation} as a previous step to obtaining
    biomarkers for chemotherapy sensitivity
  \item 30--45 cell lines characterized by increasing sensitivity to
    several chemotherapy drugs were analyzed using high-throughput
    methods:\emph{ transcriptomics, methylation, miRNAs, SNPs}, and
    \emph{proteomics}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Patterns of (negative) association}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Considering the relation between methylation and expression in cancer (the higher methylation the lower the expression...)
\item leads to expecting that scatterplots depicting the relation between methylation and expression show a negative correlation.
\item This is so and indeed genes known to be regulated by methylation use to show an L-shape pattern in these plots.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/Lshapes1.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Selecting genes by mining scatterplots}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Assuming the relation described above is true...
\item Finding genes regulated by methylation is equivalent to finding genes whose methylation--expression scatterplot has an L--shape.
\item There is a scatterplot \emph{per} gene and thousands of genes: An automatic method for selecting interesting genes through their scatterplots is needed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Objectives}
The main objectives of this work are:
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Study how gene expression is regulated by methylation in a set of colon cancer cell lines.\\
%\item Set up a method to detect the level of methylation at which a gene can be considered regulated by methylation (to be "on").\\
%\item Compare this method with other existing that have been developed to\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item detect methylation thresholds
%\item detect patterns in scatterplots
%\end{itemize} 
\item To compare available methods  for scatterplot clustering, \\ or to derive new ones if needed.
\item To apply the selected methods on a specific CRC dataset and validate the findings based on their biological relevance.
\item As a secondary objective deriving a binarization point enabling to call a gene ``methylated'' or ``unmethylated'' would also be desired.
\end{enumerate} 

\end{frame}

\section{Methods for selecting L--shaped patterns}

\begin{frame}{Overview of approaches}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have investigated three approaches for selecting L--shaped patterns in scatterplots
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use Conditional Mutual Information to detect threshold point and select genes.
\item Clustering scatterplots based on the results of Splines Regression and select L-shape clusters.
\item \emph{Apply Functional Data Analysis techniques to estimate shapes and cluster to extract L--paterns.}
\end{enumerate}
\item Only the first two have provided interesting results so the third is omitted.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Selection based on conditional mutual information}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Selection based on conditional mutual information}
This method was originally proposed by Liu (2012) to study a huge (hundreds of multi--cancer samples) TCGA dataset.\\
Assume 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item That the genes we want to select show an L--shape pattern. 
\item That methylation is \emph{truly binary}
\end{itemize}
This has two implications:
\begin{itemize}
\item The reflection point of the L-shape is an appropriate choice to
  binarize methylation data % \footnote{That is values on the left of this point can be considered to be methylated and values on the right can be considered to be unmethylated}, 
and
\item Conditioning on the binarized on-off methylation status, the
  continuous valued methylation data and expression data should be
  independent% \footnote{That is both branches of the ``L'' pattern show many differenta wide range of values of methylation (left) or expression (right) for a small range of values of expression (left) or methylation (right) which suggest that once we are on one or other side of the binarization point methylation and expression are independent}.
\end{itemize}

\framebreak
\begin{itemize}
\item A relevant issue is how the continuous methylation data are binarized.
\item Liu (2012) suggested to use different thresholds,\\
 and select the threshold that best separated the two regions.
\item The ``best'' criteria is based on computing mutual information.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Mutual Information and Conditional Mutual Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item   \emph{Mutual Information} between two random variables $X$
and $Y$ measures the information that these variables share.
% it measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other.  
\item For discrete variables it is defined as:
\[
 I(X;Y)= \sum_{y \in Y} \sum_{x \in X} 
                 p(x,y) \log{ \left(\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\,p(y)}
                              \right) }, \,\!
\]
%where $p(x,y)$ is the joint probability distribution function of $X$ and $Y$, and $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the marginal probability distribution functions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
\item Knowledge of a third variable, $Z$, can increase or decrease the mutal
information between $X$ and $Y$.
\item \emph{Conditional Mutual Information} is the expected value of $I(X;Y)$ once $Z$ is
known.
\[
I(X;Y|Z) = \mathbb E_Z \big[ I(X;Y)|Z\big ]
\]
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% I(X;Y|Z) &=& \mathbb E_Z \big(I(X;Y)|Z\big) \\
%    &=& \sum_{z\in Z} p_Z(z) \sum_{y\in Y} \sum_{x\in X}
%      p_{X,Y|Z}(x,y|z) \log \frac{p_{X,Y|Z}(x,y|z)}{p_{X|Z}(x|z)p_{Y|Z}(y|z)},
% \end{eqnarray*}
\end{itemize}

\framebreak

\begin{block}{The key idea}
To determine whether methylation and expression of a gene exhibit an L-shape,
one can compute the conditional Mutual Information (MI) for different choices of threshold
to binarize the methylation data.
\end{block}
If we consider the continuous valued methylation and expression data as two random variables
$X$ and $Y$, and denote a nominal threshold as $t$, the conditional MI can be written as a
weighted sum of MIs on the two sides of the threshold.
\[
\mathit{cMI}(t)=I(X,Y|X>t) P(X>t) + I(X,Y|X\le t)P(X\le t)
\]
\end{frame}
%\framebreak

\begin{frame} {Optimal threshold for binarizing methylation data}
\begin{itemize}
\item When $t$ is $0$ or $1$, $\mathit{cMI}$ equals to the mutual information derived 
from all data points, so:
\item 
for an L-shape gene, as $t$ moves from 0 to 1, $\mathit{cMI}(t)$ first decreases and then
increases, and its value approaches zero when $t$ coincides with the reflection point. 
Therefore,
\begin{block}{Optimal threshold}
% The ratio $r=\frac{\min\{\mathit{cMI}(t)\}}{\mathit{cMI}(0)}$ for an L-shape gene is small, 
$t^{\ast} = \mathrm{argmin}\{ \mathit{cMI}(t) \}$ is the optimal threshold for 
dichotomizing the methylation data of this gene.
\end{block}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3cm]{./images/cMI-methylation.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Joint distribution estimator}
To estimate the MI terms we use a kernel-based estimator, which constructs a joint
probability distribution by applying a Gaussian kernel to each data point, and estimates
the MI based on the joint distribution. The estimator is as follows:
\[
I(X,Y) = \frac 1M \sum_{i=1}^M \log\frac{M\sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}((x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2)}}{%
                                      \sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}(x_i-x_j)^2} \sum_{j=1}^M e^{-\frac{1}{2h^2}(y_i-y_j)^2}}
\]
where $h$ is a tuning parameter for the kernel width and empirically set $h=0.3$.
% i and j are indices for samples.
% In our analysis, we normalize the expression data to zero mean.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Results from using cMI to select genes}

\begin{frame}{Results (1) Conditional Mutual Information}
\begin {itemize}
\item Data: Expression and Methylation values from 30 cell lines: two 30 $\times$ 11746 arrays.
\item No previous filtering of the genes was needed/performed
%\begin{block}{Criteria used for selecting genes}
\item We filtered for L-shapes using a combination of three criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Genes with ``small'' ratio $r<0.25$
\item Minimum value of unconditioned MI $\mathit{cMI}(0)>0.1$
\item Median expression on the left side of the optimal threshold $t^{\ast}$ must be higher
than median expression on the right side.
\end{itemize}
%\end{block}
\item Liu(2012) suggests using a random permutation test to select parameter values.
We are considering cross-validation
\item % According to the above criteria, 
\textbf{A total of 641 genes are selected to be L-shape genes}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Selection based on Spline regression}

\begin{frame}{Spline Regression}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression based on splines is a form of non-parametric
  regression that automatically models non-linearities and
  interactions between variables.
\item This is done using \emph{Splines},  continuous functions formed by connecting linear
segments. The points where the segments connect are called the \emph{knots} of the spline.
\item A particularly efficient form of splines regresion is  $B$-splines.
\begin {itemize}
\item $\varsigma=\lbrace t_1 < \cdots < t_N \rbrace$ non decreasing  knot sequence 
\item $\left[ t_m,t_{m+1} \right)$ half open interval
\item $B_{mp}$ $p$-th order polynomial (degree $p-1$) with finite support over the interval and 0 everywhere else so that  $\sum_{m=1}^{N-p}B_{mp}(x)=1$
\item then  $s(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{N-p}B_{mp}(x)c_m$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering using Spline regression}
To represent the curve we set:
\[
y_{ij}=s(x_{ij})
\]
So
\[ 
\mathbf{y}_i=\mathbf{B}_i\mathbf{c}
\]
with
\begin {itemize}
\item $\mathbf{B}_i=\left[ B_{1p}\mathbf{x}_i,B_{2p}\mathbf{x}_i,\dots,B_{Lp}\mathbf{x}_i \right]$ the spline basis matrix
\item $\mathbf{c}$ the vector of spline coefficients.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering using Spline regression (3)}
Algorithm
\begin {enumerate}
\item Selection of the genes with a negative significant correlation
\item Fit cubic regression splines
\item Data to cluster: splines coefficients
\item Calculation of a distance matrix between genes as $1-\rho$
\item Hierarchical clustering 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Results from using cMIsplines regression to select genes}

\begin {frame}{Results (2) Splines--based regression}
\begin {itemize}
\item After the previous selection of genes we worked with 191 genes
\item We decided to choose 5 clusters
\item The 2 first clusters included the genes with an L-shape

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have found similar results between both methods.
  \item Biological interpretation is still being done by biological
    researchers although results are consistent with the hypothesis
    (we have found genes regulated by methylation).
  \item Sample size is a limiting factor: cMI works better with
    hundreds of samples but one may have a very small number (real
    cases: 30, 12)
